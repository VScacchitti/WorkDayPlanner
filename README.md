# WorkDayPlanner
In this deployed application we have a Work Day Planner that runs from the hours of 9am-6pm.  Past, current, and future time blocks are delineated by different colors.  Events that are added onto the planner are saved in local storage.  Skills used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
