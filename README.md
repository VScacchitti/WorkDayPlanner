# WorkDayPlanner
In this deployed application we have a Work Day Planner that runs from the hours of 9am-6pm.  Past, current, and future time blocks are delineated by different colors.  Events that are added onto the planner are saved in local storage.  Skills used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

All Hours in the future
